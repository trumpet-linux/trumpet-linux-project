The trumpet-linux project is about a tool (linux + raspberry pi b+) capable of assisting computer network users in their homes, in business and at industrial level troubleshooting networks problems.

The trumpet-linux project is about a tool capable of assisting computer network users in their homes, in business and at industrial level troubleshooting networks problems.
Most computer users only have superficial knowledge of how computer networks works and much less knowledge when segmenting the network structure in hardware and software layers. When a problem in the network arises, the trumpet-linux project aims to help the network user disentangle these layers, showing what is working and what is not working thus leading the user to the probable source of the problem.
The trumpet-linux project aims to give a clear, precise, robust and independent vision of the network status facilitating the understanding of how a TCP/IP network works. This could save a lot of troubleshooting time, spare the end-user of unnecessary hassle, and improve the network efficiency.
Similar expensive tools are already in use by computer technicians but the trumpet-linux project also aims to transform this kind of tool into a cheap, accessible and popular indispensable item for any size of computer network.

Hardware must be cheap, accessible for the masses, ideally under US$100.00 
The utilization of embedded boards already made and largely available should reduce acquisition costs. 

In this case, the device chosen is the latest Raspberry Pi B+ which has Ethernet and Wireless modules.

No Hardware modification will be necessary and trumpet-linux project will be just software.
